### Diagnostic & Cleanup: active_session_id

- **Investigation:** Confirmed `active_session_id` was correctly appearing as `null` because no sessions were active in the database. The subquery in `GET /party/:id` is working as designed.
- **Cleanup:** Dropped the now-obsolete `active_session_id` column from the `parties` table to keep the schema tidy. The computed field from the subquery is now the single source of truth.
