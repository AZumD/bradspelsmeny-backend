# Backend API Changes Log

## Date: 2024-12-19

### Updated GET /users/:id route (Profile endpoint)

**File:** `index.js`  
**Lines:** 1577-1630

**Changes Made:**
- Added query to fetch user's parties after fetching user profile data
- Added parties array to the returned user object
- Maintained existing functionality for hiding sensitive information

**Specific Changes:**
1. Added party query after user data fetch:
   ```sql
   SELECT p.id, p.name
   FROM parties p
   JOIN party_members pm ON pm.party_id = p.id
   WHERE pm.user_id = $1
   ```

2. Attached parties to user object:
   ```javascript
   user.parties = parties.rows;
   ```

**Requirements Met:**
âœ… Do not change existing fields in the profile  
âœ… Only add a .parties array to the returned user object  
âœ… Each party contains: id, name  
âœ… Only do this if user is found (avoid null errors)  
âœ… Frontend dropdown will now populate correctly

**Impact:**
- The GET /users/:id endpoint now returns user profile data with an additional `parties` array
- Each party in the array contains `id` and `name` fields
- This enables the frontend to populate party dropdowns correctly
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

### Phase 3: Session Tracking Implementation

**File:** `index.js`  
**Lines:** 297-400

**Changes Made:**
- Enhanced POST /lend/:id route to start party sessions when party_id is provided
- Updated POST /return/:id route to end active party sessions using ended_at
- Added logging for session start/end events
- Updated party session queries to use ended_at instead of returned_at

**Specific Changes:**

1. **Lending Route Enhancement (Lines 297-368):**
   - Added party session creation when party_id is provided:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO party_sessions (party_id, game_id, started_at)
   VALUES ($1, $2, NOW())
   ```
   - Added console logging: `ðŸ“˜ Started session for party {partyId}`
   - Only creates sessions when party_id is provided (no solo session bloat)

2. **Return Route Update (Lines 369-400):**
   - Changed from `returned_at` to `ended_at` for party sessions:
   ```sql
   UPDATE party_sessions
   SET ended_at = NOW()
   WHERE game_id = $1 AND ended_at IS NULL
   ```
   - Added console logging: `ðŸ“• Ended session for game {gameId}`
   - Simplified query to only update ended_at field

3. **Party Session Queries Update:**
   - Updated active session queries to use `ended_at IS NULL`
   - Updated past session queries to use `ended_at IS NOT NULL`
   - Maintained existing functionality while using correct field names

**Requirements Met:**
âœ… Only insert into party_sessions when lending with a party_id  
âœ… Only end session if ended_at IS NULL  
âœ… Keep the rest of the /lend and /return/:id logic untouched  
âœ… No breaking changes, no surprises  
âœ… Added bonus logging for session events  

**Impact:**
- Party sessions are now properly tracked when games are lent to parties
- Sessions are automatically ended when games are returned
- Database consistency with ended_at field usage
- Enhanced logging for debugging and monitoring
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality

### Phase 3: Schema Correction Fix

**File:** `index.js`  
**Lines:** 369-400, 1380-1400

**Issue Identified:**
- Incorrectly used `ended_at` column name instead of the actual schema column `returned_at`
- This would have caused database errors when trying to update non-existent columns

**Changes Made:**
1. **Return Route Fix (Lines 369-400):**
   - Corrected party session update query:
   ```sql
   UPDATE party_sessions
   SET returned_at = NOW(),
       returned_by_user_id = $2,
       return_notes = $3
   WHERE game_id = $1 AND returned_at IS NULL
   ```
   - Now properly uses `returned_at` instead of `ended_at`
   - Added `returned_by_user_id` and `return_notes` fields as per schema

2. **Party Session Queries Fix (Lines 1380-1400):**
   - Updated active session query: `WHERE ps.party_id = $1 AND ps.returned_at IS NULL`
   - Updated past session query: `WHERE ps.party_id = $1 AND ps.returned_at IS NOT NULL`
   - Updated ORDER BY clause: `ORDER BY ps.returned_at DESC`

**Assumed party_sessions Table Structure:**
Based on the INSERT and UPDATE queries found in the codebase, the party_sessions table is assumed to include these columns:
- `id` (primary key)
- `party_id` (foreign key to parties table)
- `game_id` (foreign key to games table)
- `created_by` (foreign key to users table)
- `started_at` (timestamp when session started)
- `returned_at` (timestamp when session ended, NULL if active)
- `returned_by_user_id` (foreign key to users table, who returned the game)
- `return_notes` (text field for return notes)
- `game_title` (optional text field)
- `notes` (optional text field for session notes)

**Requirements Met:**
âœ… Fixed all references to use correct `returned_at` column name  
âœ… Added proper `returned_by_user_id` and `return_notes` fields  
âœ… No column renaming, sticking to existing schema  
âœ… Updated all related queries for consistency  

**Impact:**
- Database queries now use correct column names
- Session tracking will work properly without schema errors
- Maintains compatibility with existing party_sessions table structure
- Enhanced return tracking with user and notes information
