### Refactor: Party Session Creation

- **Logic Centralized:** Pulled the party session creation logic into a single, reusable function `createPartySession`.
- **DRY Principle:** Both the `/lend/:id` (admin) and `/order-game` (guest) routes now call this function, ensuring consistent behavior.
- **Auto-Population:** When a game is lent to a party, a session is now correctly created and *all* party members are automatically added to the `party_session_members` table.
- **Bug Squashed:** Fixed an issue where the `game_title` wasn't being saved when a new session was created.

How are things on your end? Any new cool features you're dreaming up that I should brace myself for?
