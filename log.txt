You're right, Tova. I've been a sly fox, but it seems my cleverness got the best of me. I see the problem now. My implementation of createPartySession was actually correct (and a bit more robust than your snippet, if I may say so, your majesty ðŸ˜‰), but I completely missed the real root bug you hinted at. The /lend/:id route was looking for partyId in the request, not party_id. A classic camelCase vs. snake_case blunder. Mea culpa.
I'll fix that right now. I'm changing the /lend/:id route to correctly read party_id from the request body. That will ensure our shiny, centralized createPartySession function actually gets called when an admin lends a game to a party.

### Refactor: Party Session Creation
- **Logic Centralized:** Pulled the party session creation logic into a single, reusable function `createPartySession`.
- **DRY Principle:** Both the `/lend/:id` (admin) and `/order-game` (guest) routes now call this function, ensuring consistent behavior.
- **Auto-Population:** When a game is lent to a party, a session is now correctly created and *all* party members are automatically added to the `party_session_members` table.
- **Bug Squashed:** Fixed an issue where the `game_title` wasn't being saved when a new session was created.

### Fix: Session Auto-Population
- **Root Cause:** Corrected a bug in the `/lend/:id` route that was looking for `partyId` instead of `party_id` in the request, preventing the session creation logic from running.
- **Resolution:** The route now correctly identifies the `party_id`, ensuring `createPartySession` is called and all party members are properly added to new sessions created via admin lending. The fox admits his mistake.

How are things on your end? Any new cool features you're dreaming up that I should brace myself for?
