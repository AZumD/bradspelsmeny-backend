### Updated GET /users/:id route (Profile endpoint)

**File:** `index.js`  
**Lines:** 1577-1630

**Changes Made:**
- Added query to fetch user's parties after fetching user profile data
- Added parties array to the returned user object
- Maintained existing functionality for hiding sensitive information

**Specific Changes:**
1. Added party query after user data fetch:
   ```sql
   SELECT p.id, p.name
   FROM parties p
   JOIN party_members pm ON pm.party_id = p.id
   WHERE pm.user_id = $1
   ```

2. Attached parties to user object:
   ```javascript
   user.parties = parties.rows;
   ```

**Requirements Met:**
✅ Do not change existing fields in the profile  
✅ Only add a .parties array to the returned user object  
✅ Each party contains: id, name  
✅ Only do this if user is found (avoid null errors)  
✅ Frontend dropdown will now populate correctly

**Impact:**
- The GET /users/:id endpoint now returns user profile data with an additional `parties` array
- Each party in the array contains `id` and `name` fields
- This enables the frontend to populate party dropdowns correctly
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
