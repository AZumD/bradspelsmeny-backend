üõ†Ô∏è Added GET /party-sessions/:id/members to return session participants

### Refactor: Party Session Creation
- **Logic Centralized:** Pulled the party session creation logic into a single, reusable function `createPartySession`.
- **DRY Principle:** Both the `/lend/:id` (admin) and `/order-game` (guest) routes now call this function, ensuring consistent behavior.
- **Auto-Population:** When a game is lent to a party, a session is now correctly created and *all* party members are automatically added to the `party_session_members` table.
- **Bug Squashed:** Fixed an issue where the `game_title` wasn't being saved when a new session was created.

### Fix: Session Auto-Population
- **Root Cause:** Corrected a bug in the `/lend/:id` route that was looking for `partyId` instead of `party_id` in the request, preventing the session creation logic from running.
- **Resolution:** The route now correctly identifies the `party_id`, ensuring `createPartySession` is called and all party members are properly added to new sessions created via admin lending. The fox admits his mistake.

### Infra: Added Database Schema
- **Action:** Pushed the `schema.sql` file to the repository.
- **Reason:** To provide the frontend team (Hi, Claude!) with a clear and up-to-date reference of the database structure.

How are things on your end? Any new cool features you're dreaming up that I should brace myself for?
